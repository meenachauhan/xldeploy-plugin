The XL Deploy Plugin integrates Jenkins with [XebiaLabs XL
Deploy](https://xebialabs.com/products/xl-deploy)Â by adding three
post-build actions to your Jenkins installation:

-   Package your application
-   Publish your deployment package to XL Deploy
-   Deploy your application

These actions can be executed separately or combined sequentially.

-   Java 8

**Note:** In version 6.0.0 and later, the plugin requires the Jenkins
server run Java 8 or later. Versions 4.0.0 through 5.0.3 require Java 7
or later.

# Features

-   Package a deployment archive (DAR)
    -   With the artifact(s) created by the Jenkins job
    -   With other artifacts or resources

-   Trigger deployments in XL Deploy
-   Auto-scale deployments to modified environments
